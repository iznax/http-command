Http-Command.exe is a command-line utility to download files from a web server.

Example:

```
    HttpCommand -S http:\\http-command.googlecode/svn/trunk c:\MyProject
```

This will copy all the files and sub-directories to the local folder.

This can be useful if you want to grab some code from a project and for whatever reason don't want to install Subversion.
